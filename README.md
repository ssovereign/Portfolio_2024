# My Portfolio:

## Learning Objectives:
- Continue learning HTML and CSS, building on my knowledge from CSCI 201
- Incorporate cool 3D effects and animations into my portfolio
- Learn how to use JavaScript to make my portfolio interactive
- Learn TypeScript
- Learn about how to set up a project in WebStorm with Node.js and npm
- Practice using GitHub for version control

### Day 1:
- Created a new repository on GitHub
- Set up the project structure with dist, src (html and typescript)
- Created a README.md file
- Imported many modules such as webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-dev-server, typescript, ts-loader, html-webpack-plugin, and clean-webpack-plugin
- Started a server to test my website
- Created a basic HTML file with a header and a paragraph
- Created a basic TypeScript file 
- Debugged errors around webpack.config.json and directory issues in my src files
- SUCCESS: Managed to get a three.js cube up and running on localhost!

In CSCI 201 we learned about Eclipse and Tomcat. We used Java - based on my understanding, Node.js seems to similar except we use Javascript for the backend too instead of just dynamically updating frontend, and we use Node for launching a server. Just a preliminary hypothesis though.
